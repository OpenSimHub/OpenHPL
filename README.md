# OpenHPL

OpenHPL is an open-source hydropower library that consists of hydropower unit models and is modelled using Modelica.

## Library description

The OpenHPL makes it possible to model hydropower systems of different complexity and connect them
with models from other libraries, e.g., with models of the power system or other power generating
sources.

More information about the library can be found in the [User's Guide](OpenHPL/Resources/Documents/UsersGuide.pdf) and the following [PhD Thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/11250/2608105).
