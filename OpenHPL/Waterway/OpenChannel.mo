<p>
This is a model for the open channel (river).
Could be used for modelling of run-of-river hydropower plants.
</p>
<p>
In this model it is assumed that the channel has the inlet and
outlet from the bottom of the left and right sides, respectevely.
</p>
<p>
That is why this open channel should be connected from both sides to the
<a href=\"modelica://OpenHPL.Waterway.Pipe\">Pipe</a> elements.
Connectors hold information about the inlet/outlet flow rate and the pressures
 that is defined as sum of atmospheric pressure and pressure of the water (depends on depth).
</p>
<p>
As boundary conditions, at least two of the four quentities
(inlet flow or depth and outlet flow or depth) should be used.
</p>
<p>Perhaps, this structure is not really useful and some modification should be done.
This is still under discussion and has not been tested properly.
</p>
<p>More info about the original model can be found in
<a href=\"modelica://OpenHPL.UsersGuide.References\">[Vytvytskyi2015]</a>.</p>
